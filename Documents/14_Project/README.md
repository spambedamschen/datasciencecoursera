## Step 1
Merging Data with cbind for x_train, subject_train and y_train and the equivalent of the test data.
After that I rowbinded the two data frames - the one for train and the other one for test

## Step 2
By extracting the second column of the feature file I got the names
with the names(data) comand I added the names to the variable

## Step 3
THe third step for me was the subsetting of the columns including std and mean.
Unfortunately somehow I did not get the hang of using the grep function and failed at this point :(
